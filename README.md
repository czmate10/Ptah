# Ptah

Ptah is a 3D game engine written in C++. The sole purpose of this project is for me to learn the language. I've started the project in early January, 2018. 
Ptah uses a component-based system for its entities similiar to Unity Engine to ensure that there is as little coupling in the engine as possible.
It also uses a very basic event-system for communications between systems which I intend to improve at later stages of development
